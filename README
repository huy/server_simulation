# Server simulation

This is simple Monte Carlo simulation of the behaviour of multi servers 
behind round robin load balancer under load.

In the model, there is fixed output capacity per each type of requests and
we can play with different number of servers to calculate total wait time for
each type of requests.

## Stochastic process assumptions

* requests arrive at the system with length of inter-arrival times following http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution
* service time per request type follows http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution
 
## Requirements

* python version >= 2.4 
* numpy and scipy python libaries

## Running

python simulation.py 10 500000

where

* 10 is number of servers
* 500000 is number of observed requests
